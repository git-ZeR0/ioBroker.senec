The newest change log is [README.md](README.md)

### 1.2.0 (NoBl)
* Added datapoints for: PM1OBJ1, PM1OBJ2, EG_CONTROL, RTC, PM1, TEMPMEASURE, DEBUG, SOCKETS, CASC, WALLBOX, CONNX50, STECA (please report wrong / missing units).
* Adapter now calculates day/week/month/year-values for: STATISTIC.LIVE_GRID_EXPORT, STATISTIC.LIVE_GRID_IMPORT, STATISTIC.LIVE_HOUSE_CONS, STATISTIC.LIVE_PV_GEN, STATISTIC.LIVE_BAT_CHARGE_MASTER, STATISTIC.LIVE_BAT_DISCHARGE_MASTER. Calculated values can be found below the "_calc." datapoint. Information about daily values was removed from the API by SENEC in the past. So here we go again ...

### 1.1.1 (NoBl)
* Object attributes are updated to what they are expected to be: unit, description, datatype (this will break anything that still relies on datapoints being STRING that aren't meant to be string)

### 1.1.0 (NoBl)
* Updated to current adapter template
* Integrated GitHub Testing and auto npm publishing
* Some other administrative updates

### 1.0.13 (NoBl)
* Added System Description 19 for Senec.Home V3 Hybrid (Credits to noffycws)
* Added Mode Descriptions for 86-91. (Credits to noffycws)

### 1.0.12 (NoBl)
* Just set 'supportCustoms' to false so it won't show up in admin custom config.

### 1.0.11 (NoBl)
* Update to current adapter template
* Added Datapoints: PV1.MPP_CUR, MPP_VOL, MPP_POWER (former: MPP_INT which is unused at this moment but does still exist)
* Added Datapoints (please feedback any improvements for their descriptions, ...): FEATURES.SGREADY, WIZARD.SETUP_WALLBOX_MAX_TOTAL_CURRENT_BY_GRID, WIZARD.SG_READY_CURR_MODE, BMS.ERROR, BMS.RECOVERLOCKED, BMS.SERIAL, BMS.START_SELFTEST, BAT1.RESET, BAT1.SELFTEST_ACT, BAT1.SELFTEST_LIMIT, BAT1.SELFTEST_OFF, BAT1.SELFTEST_OVERALL_STATE, BAT1.SELFTEST_STATE, BAT1.SELFTEST_STEP, BAT1.SELFTEST_TIME, BAT1.SERIAL, BAT1.TRIG_ITALY_SELF, BAT1OBJ1.COMM, GRIDCONFIG.AU_SOFT_RAMP_EN, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VRR_MAX, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VRR_MIN, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_PERCENTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_P_MAX, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_P_MIN, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_VOLTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VWC_VOLTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VWD_VOLTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.CEI_SEGNALE_ESTERNO, GRIDCONFIG.VDELVFRTDISABLE, GRIDCONFIG.VDEURMSMAX10

### 1.0.10 (NoBl, smartpran)
* DateType objects are stored as date again
* changed WIZARD.SETUP_POWER_RULE unit to '%'
* changed name of STATISTIC.STAT_SUM_E_PU to "STAT_SUM Energy PowerUnit"
* changed name of STATISTIC.STAT_SUM_E_WB to "STAT_SUM Energy Wallbox"
* changed name of STATISTIC.LIVE_WB_ENERGY to "Live Wallbox Energy"
* changed name of STATISTIC.LIVE_PU_ENERGY to "Live PowerUnit Energy"
* changed name of WIZARD.PWRCFG_PEAK_PV_POWER to "Configured Peak PV Power"
* enforcing conversion of number values to Number(). Otherwise they are created as String in ioBroker (manually delete existing datapoints in ioBroker to change them!)
* fixed representation for temp values (off by *10)
* json delivers a non-value (apparently an error message produced by senec itself). Ignoring that.
* Added variable mpp_int to high priority and changed unit it. (smartpran)

### 1.0.9 (NoBl)
* IP types are shown as IP again.
* added datapoints for FACTORY along with more state descriptions for Battery Type, Country and System Type.
* added datapoints for GRIDCONFIG

### 1.0.8 (NoBl)
* Added more states to known states (please feedback if they need special handling (unit, special description, value modification, ...))
* Bugfix in creating debug data
* Unknown states are now reported in debug instead of info.
* Code cleanup

### 1.0.7 (NoBl)
* Reading all known states from SENEC.
* Split states into high/low priority (heavy requesting the SENEC system renders it unable to sync with the SENEC datacenter!).
* Updated adapter-core and testing versions along with current dev dependencies. Removed node 8 support.
* Added more state descriptions to manual. But need input on these and those that are still not documented.

### 1.0.6 (NoBl)
* Moved senec states and state attributes to libs
* Added missing state descriptions

### 1.0.5 (2020-03-07) (NoBl)
* Added States for: Energy: GUI_BAT_DATA_VOLTAGE, GUI_BAT_DATA_CURRENT, STAT_HOURS_OF_OPERATION; Sys_update: NPU_VER, NPU_IMAGE_VERSION, Wizard: APPLICATION_VERSION, INTERFACE_VERSION
* Readme and Documentation (EN exists, now) updated
* Changed behavior for unknown values completely. They will now be stored as string plus prefixed with "REPORT TO DEV:" so users can easily report back what needs updating.
* added handling for "st_" values in json
* added additional configuration options
* changed retry-behaviour in case of connection issues, ...

### 1.0.4 (2020-03-06)

* (NoBl) updated readme

### 1.0.0
